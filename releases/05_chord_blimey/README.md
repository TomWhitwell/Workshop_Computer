# Chord Blimey!

**Chord Blimey!** is an arpeggiator for the [Music Thing Modular Workshop Computer](https://www.musicthing.co.uk/workshopcomputer/) that generates arpeggios from selected chords, with multiple playback directions, configurable sequence length, and random CV outputs for extra patch variation.

## Overview

Send a trigger to the Workshop Computer and it outputs an arpeggiated chord on **CV Out 1**, with a matching trigger on **Pulse Out 1** for each note.  
When the full arpeggio cycle ends, **Pulse Out 2** fires so you can chain or loop sequences.

You can control **root pitch**, **chord type**, **speed**, **sequence length**, and **arpeggiator direction** using the Workshop Computer’s knobs, CV inputs, and toggle switch.  

Random voltages on **Audio Out 1 & 2** change probabilistically at the end of each chord, for modulation sources.

## Inputs & Outputs

| Jack / Control | Function |
|----------------|----------|
| **Pulse In 1** | Starts the arpeggio when triggered. If patched from Pulse Out 2, the arpeggio will loop. |
| **Pulse In 2** | Not used in this program. |
| **CV In 1**    | Adds to the root note (in volts). 1V = 1 octave. |
| **CV In 2**    | Adds to the chord selection (0–1V range). |
| **CV Out 1**   | Current note of the arpeggio (root + chord degree). |
| **CV Out 2**   | Root note of the chord (constant for the duration of the chord). |
| **Pulse Out 1**| Fires for each note in the arpeggio. |
| **Pulse Out 2**| Fires when the last note of the arpeggio plays (also at startup). |
| **Audio Out 1**| Random voltage 0–1V (changes at chord end). |
| **Audio Out 2**| Random voltage 0–1V (changes at chord end). |

## Controls

| Control | Function |
|---------|----------|
| **Big Knob (Z Pot)** | Controls arpeggio speed (note length). Faster at higher settings. |
| **X Knob (X Pot)**   | Controls root note in volts (0–1V) — combined with CV In 1. |
| **Y Knob (Y Pot)**   | Selects chord type — combined with CV In 2. |
| **3-position toggle switch** | **UP**: Full-length mode (all chord notes).<br>**MID**: Fixed-length mode (limits to selected number of steps).<br>**DOWN**: Short press cycles fixed-length number (1–6 steps). Long press changes arpeggiator direction. |
| **LEDs** | Show current step in sequence during playback. Also flash a pattern when arpeggiator direction changes, or when fixed-length is adjusted. |

## Arpeggiator Modes

Long-press the toggle switch in the **DOWN** position to cycle through modes.  
LEDs briefly show a pattern for the selected mode.

1. **Up** – Ascend through notes.
2. **Down** – Descend through notes.
3. **Up-Up** – Ascend, playing each note twice.
4. **Down-Down** – Descend, playing each note twice.
5. **Up-Down Inclusive** – Ascend then descend, repeating the highest note.  
   Example (degrees): `0, 1, 3, 5, 5, 3, 1, 0`
6. **Up-Down Exclusive** – Ascend then descend, skipping repeats at both ends.  
   Example (degrees): `0, 1, 3, 5, 3, 1`

When in fixed-length mode, these modes still respect the step count — extra notes are generated by octave jumps if needed.

## Sequence Length

- In **MID** position, the number of steps is fixed (1–6).
- Short press the toggle in **DOWN** position to increase step count (wraps around after 6).
- If the chord has fewer notes than the selected steps, higher octaves are added automatically.

---

## Random Outputs

- **Audio Out 1 & 2** output random voltages 0–1V.
- They change **only at the end of a chord**.
- The probability of change starts low and increases each time until a change happens, then resets.

---

## End-of-Arpeggio Output

**Pulse Out 2** always fires at the end of an arpeggio cycle.  
This can be used to:
- Trigger another module at phrase boundaries.
- Feed back into **Pulse In 1** for self-looping arpeggios.

## Typical Patch Example

1. Patch **Pulse Out 2 → Pulse In 1** to make the arp self-loop.
2. Patch **CV Out 1** to a VCO’s pitch input.
3. Patch **Pulse Out 1** to your VCA or envelope.
4. Use **X/Y knobs** (or CV In 1/2) to choose key and chord.
5. Use **Z knob** to set note speed.
6. Use toggle and short/long presses to set step length and arpeggiator mode.
7. Optionally, send **Audio Out 1/2** to modulate filters, LFO rates, etc.
