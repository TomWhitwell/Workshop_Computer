56_Krell 

This is the Krell card. It is inspired by Todd Barton's Krell patching and the music of the 1956 film Forbidden Planet. 

The card spits out two separate channels of random pitches and looping AD envelopes with random attack and decay per cycle as well as pulses at the beginning of the cycle. Each channel is independent of each other, but they share some controls. The audio/cv/pulse outs and the cv ins are in two sets. Audio/CV/Pulse Out & CV 


Outputs:

The 


Audio Out 1/2 are looping envelopes with random attack and decay. CV Out 1/2 are random pitches for the envelopes. Pulse Out 1/2 are end of cycle pulses for each envelope. The Main Knob is scale for the overall randomness. Full CCW will be very short envelopes Full CW will be longer ones in general. Knobs x/y do the same thing but for each channel seperately. Copious reverb and echo at the end of chain are highly recommended! Much thanks to Dune for the blackbird card.
