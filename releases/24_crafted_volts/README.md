A utility card for the WS Computer to manually set control voltages (CV)
with the input knobs and switch. It also attenuverts (attenuates and inverts)
incoming voltages.

Crafted Volts is developed in a different GitHub repo, visit [Crafted Volts](https://codeberg.org/briandorsey/mtmws_cards/src/branch/main/crafted_volts) for documentation and to download releases of the UF2 image.
